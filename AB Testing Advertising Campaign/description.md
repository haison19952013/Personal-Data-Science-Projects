A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers.

# What Data Will I Use in This Project?
Below are all the features in the dataset:

   - Campaign Name: The name of the campaign
   - Date: Date of the record
   - Spend: Amount spent on the campaign in dollars
   - of Impressions: Number of impressions the ad crossed through the campaign
   - Reach: The number of unique impressions received in the ad
   - of Website Clicks: Number of website clicks received through the ads
   - of Searches: Number of users who performed searches on the website
   - of View Content: Number of users who viewed content and products on the website
   - of Add to Cart: Number of users who added products to the cart
   - of Purchase: Number of purchases

Two campaigns were performed by the company:
- Control Campaign
- Test Campaign


# Goal
You will be required to perform a descriptive/diagnostic analysis and hypothesis testing to provide insights on how the company can improve its advertising campaign.

# Procedure
1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   -  Understand the data by Exploring the data and visualizing it.
   -  Create a wrangle function to clean the data and make it ready for analysis.
   -  Keywords: bar plots

2. **Diagnostic Analysis**:
   -  Perform a diagnostic analysis to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable.  
   -  Keywords: pairplots, histograms, scatter plots

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Perform a hypothesis test to determine if the test campaign is better than the control campaign.
   - Compute the power (i.e., the probability of detecting the effect) based on the given sample size and the effect size.
   - Keywords: t-test, p-value, permutation test
